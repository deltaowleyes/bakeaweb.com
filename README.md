# BAKE Studio

A website design studio, and the start of BAKE: free sites on bakedby.me, RezSite sites on rezsite.com, Baker portfolios on bakedbya.pro and PRO sites on their own domains (see `VISION.md`). Live: https://bakeaweb.com/

## The five steps
1. **Your site**: import an existing website by its address (or paste its page code), including its other pages, every image, story and video rows, and podcasts. Or start fresh from a starter.
2. **Brand**: logo, hero image and illustrations from generated SVG artwork, your own uploads, AI images, or images found on your site. Plus colours and fonts.
3. **Sections**: pick a page, then add, delete, reorder and fully edit every section and its items (including any image from your site), with a live preview. Section types include video galleries, podcasts and page headers.
4. **Menu**: menu links and groups, and a separate menu style for desktop, tablet and phone.
5. **Templates**: 24 templates, filtered to the ones that fit your sections and menu. Previews are full-page screenshots (desktop, tablet, phone), not live page code. Preview any page of your site in any template. Pick one and request development with notes for changes.

Progress is saved in the browser for now. Supabase (logins, saved projects, change requests, and OpenAI images through a secure function) comes next.

## Built with
React + Vite + Tailwind CSS for the studio. The generated websites stay plain HTML and CSS, because previews are screenshots of them.

## Files
- `studio/`: the source code (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- `index.html` and `assets/`: the built studio that GitHub Pages serves (made by `npm run build` in `studio/`)
